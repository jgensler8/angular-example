# angular-swagger-example

There are several directories in this repo.

## `swagger-backend`

This contains code necessary for editing swagger.yaml. It is from this repo that both Angular and Node.js code is generated.

## `my-app`

This contains the front end code (Angular)

## `my-app-backend`

This contains the backend code (Node.js)

## nginx

This contains a Dockerfile to, admittedly, not worry about CORS.
